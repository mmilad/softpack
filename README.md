# softpack


If you have any questions or want to support this project please write me at meistermilad@gmail.com

Softpack takes a <a href="#config">configuration</a> to perform function/s on the given context of files that where registered through an regEx.

a small starter script could look like this:

<pre>
<code>
var softpack = require('softpack');
var path = require('path');
var nodeSass = require('node-sass');

softpack.server({
  dist: 'dist',
  src: 'src',
  rootPath: path.resolve(__dirname),
  actions:[
    {
      test: '**/*.scss'
      render: [
        function(context, objectData, yourSoftPackConfig) {
          return nodeSass.renderSync({
              data: context,
              file: objectData.fullPath,
              outputStyle: "expanded"
          }).css
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
})
</code>
</pre>
this would watch all files in your project with the extension '.scss' and compile it to css files

every render or init function will get three parameters. 
 - context of current processed file
 - object of current processed file 
 - configuration passed to softpack


It comes with two function.
<pre>
var softpack = require("softpack")

/* run developement server */
softpack.server(config)

/* run build process */
softpack.build(config)
</pre>











<h4 id="config">config options:</h4>

</pre>


the `softpack.server` and `softpack.build` function take the same configuration


<h1 id ="asd">foo</h1>
Configuration for server/build:

 - `src` path to source directory
 - `dist` path to build directory
 - `rootPath` absolute path to project
 - `port` default is 8000
 - `host` default is '0.0.0.0' ( localhost / yourIp)
 - `ignore` an array of strings with an anymatch pattern to ignore directories / files
 - `socketCallbacks` an object with `[key]`: `[function]` that can be registered if socketLoad is enabled, the frontend can then emit to server to make debugging easier
 - `log` an object to specify server log output
    - `change` log if a file has changed (fa√∂se by default) 
    - `serve` log if a file was served (false by default) 
    - `add` log if a file was added to memory (true by default) 
    - `delete` log if file was deleted from memory (true by default) 
 - `actions` an array of of objet with the following properties:
    - `socketLoad` set to true to add socket io snippet to html files (disabled on build)
    - `test` an anymatch regExp to path files like `".hbs"` (check npm anymatch package)
    - `init` an array of functions that recive 2 parameters (context and an object of the current processed configuration)
    - `render` an array of functions that recive 2 parameters (context and an object of the current processed configuration)
    - `keep` a boolean to keep or not keep original file on build (false by default)
    - `fileName` an relative path to serve the current processed file with name and extension
    - `socketLoad` set to false to add socket.io support.
    - `bundleName` a string or function which returns a string, bundles all matching files 

`socketCallbacks` example:
<pre>
...
socketCallbacks: {
    log: function(msg) {
        console.log(msg)
    },
    foo: function(o) {
        console.log("foo is emitted with", o.msg)
    }
}
...
</pre>

and on frontend
<pre>
...
socket.emit("log", "hello server")
socket.emit("foo", {
 msg: "hello foo!"   
})
...
</pre>


the diffrence between the functions inside the `init` array and the `render` array are that the functions inside the `init` array will execute once a file was added to the watcher or changed and the functions inside the `render` array are executed when the file is requested through the `fileName` path.
Render functions must return a context.

when setting the `fileName` you can add `[path]` and `[name]`.
`[path]` will be replaced with the relative path of current processed file. 
`[name]`is replaced with the name of the current processed file, but without file extension.

init function example:
<pre>
var handlebars = require('handlebars');
var hbsRenderer = function (context, config) {
    return handlebars.compile(context)({})
}
</pre>
When `hbsRenderer` is now applied to an render array it will perform the handlebars compile function,
add `{}` as the templates context and return the compiled string.
Obviously you would most likely add some more data than `{}`, but thats up to you.

render function example:
<pre>
var path = require('path');
var handlebars = require('handlebars');
var registerHbsPartial = function(context, config) {
    handlebars.registerPartial(config.fileName.replace(path.extname(config.fileName), ''), context) 
}
</pre>
here we would for example register `path/to/my/partials/person.hbs` as `person`
